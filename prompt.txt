build a flutter application which is "ATS System" 

this application consists of very simple but well designed and eye catchy UI for only two pages that are 
1. Login Page (Only the login page not Registeration page)
you can take refrence of image1(that i have provided)
which includes the email and password for and the password field has a eye button which allows user to see the password also include a login with google button 
for now hardcode the email and password that are email="admin@google.com" password="Admin@123"

2. Contracts page which is empty at first but with a button that says "+ Create new contract" we can add a contract  
the button for adding a contract will show user a form by filling that form the user can add the contracts which will be shown for example as image2(that i have provided)

for the fields in form use the refrences of the image3 and image4 (i have provided)
